#SCSS | SASS

## Preprocessing :

If your stylesheets are getting larger, more complex, and harder to maintain, this is where a preprocessor like SASS can help. It lets you use features that don't exist in CSS yet like **variables**, **mixins**, **inheritance** and other things that make writing CSS much easier.

Once you start tinkering with Sass, it will take your preprocessed Sass file and save it as a normal CSS file that you can use in your website.

The most direct way to make this happen is in your terminal. Once Sass is installed, you can compile your Sass to CSS using the sass command. You'll need to tell Sass which file to build from, and where to output CSS to. For example, running sass ```input.scss``` ```output.css``` from your terminal would take a single Sass file, ```input.scss```, and compile that file to ```output.css```.
